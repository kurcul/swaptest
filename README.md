# swaptest
The main features of the smart contract include:

Constructor: Initializes the contract with the addresses of Token 1 and Token 2, along with the fixed exchange rate between them.

swapToken1ToToken2: Allows users to swap Token 1 for Token 2. Users need to approve the contract to spend their Token 1 before calling this function. The contract transfers the specified amount of Token 1 from the sender to itself and then transfers the equivalent amount of Token 2 to the sender based on the fixed exchange rate.

swapToken2ToToken1: Allows users to swap Token 2 for Token 1. Users need to approve the contract to spend their Token 2 before calling this function. The contract transfers the specified amount of Token 2 from the sender to itself and then transfers the equivalent amount of Token 1 to the sender based on the fixed exchange rate.
